# Pokemon-1v1

This project started in Binghamton's Research Immersion program as a lab activity to make an autobattler.

Status moves and status effects are not implemented, so they will do nothing if chosen. 
Whenever the file is ran, the computer will randomly choose two pokemon to battle, both at level 1. The pokemon's images will be displayed as an added touch. 

To run the file, download all files in this repository into a single folder and into the command line terminal type "python pokemon.py"
Make sure the basic python packages are downloaded onto the terminal. Make sure to have cv2 and numpy downloaded.
